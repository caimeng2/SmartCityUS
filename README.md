# Code for "Linking smart cities and SDGs through descriptive analysis of U.S. municipalities"

## System requirements

The code was executed on macOS version 14.5 using R version 4.2.2 and Python version 3.8.3.

## Installation

Before running the code, please ensure that the packages in each `.ipynb` and `.Rmd` file are installed. Please visit each package's website for installation instructions. The typical installation time should not be more than a few minutes.

## Data and code

The list of municipalities, their population sizes, locations, and the American Community Survey data can be downloaded from https://www.nhgis.org/. The website addresses of U.S. municipalities are available at https://doi.org/10.1177/23998083231190961. The datasets generated and analyzed during the study are deposited in the folder `data`. All code is available in the current directory.

The expected runtime for each code sheet is within a few minutes, except for `07_get_text.py`, which was run on Michigan State University's High-Performance Computing Center and took a few hours.
